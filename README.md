# invest_or_not

Why should one Invest in Stock Marketing or not?

I have made a Python Model to illustrate this. In this, you will clearly see the difference between a person who only save his savings & a person who invested his savings at some rate of interest till his age of retirement. A final Conclusion is also there to get to know about how much time of difference is there between both cases as final amounts.

# Before we start, let us understand what would happen if one chooses not to invest.
Let assume you earn Rs.50,000/- per month, and you spend Rs.30,000/-towards your cost of living. The balance of Rs.20,000/- is your monthly saving.
For the sake of simplicity, let us ignore the effect of personal income tax in this discussion.

# Few simple assumptions :
- 10% salary hike every year.
- Expense is likely to go up by 8% year on year.
- You are 30 years old and plan to retire at 50. This leaves you with 20 more years to earn
- You don’t intend to work after you retire.
- Your expenses are fixed and don’t foresee any other expense.
- You decide to invest at 12% rate for next 19 year.

Going by these assumptions, here is how the cash balance will look like in 20 years. (In execution Video itself)
